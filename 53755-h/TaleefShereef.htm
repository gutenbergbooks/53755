<h2 class="main">TRANSLATOR&rsquo;S PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the course of a practice of upwards of
twenty-six years in India, I have often had occasion to regret, that I
had no publication to guide me, in my wish to become acquainted with
the properties of native medicines, which I had frequently seen, in the
hands of the Physicians of Hindoostan, productive of the most
beneficial effects in many diseases, for the cure of which our
Pharmacopeia supplied no adequate remedy; and the few which I had an
opportunity of becoming acquainted with, so far exceeded my
expectations, that I determined to make a Translation of the present
work, for my own gratification and future guidance.</p>
<p class="par">Having finished the translation, I became convinced,
that I should not have fulfilled the whole of my duty if I did not make
it public; and ill calculated as I know myself for such an undertaking,
I have ventured to offer it to the world, with all its
imperfections.</p>
<p class="par">Conscious, that the liberal minded will give me credit
for the best of motives, I shall not dread criticism; and if it has the
effect of inducing those more competent to the task to an inquiry into
the properties of native medicines, my views will have been fully
accomplished.</p>
<p class="par">In writing the names of the different medicines, I have
followed the Author&rsquo;s example, and have been guided solely by the
pronunciation, without altering the sound given to the letters in
English, and have not borrowed a single name from any work of Oriental
literature. In this I may have acted wrong, but I did so from the
conviction, that by this method, the names would be more familiar, and
better understood, by the Natives in researches after the different
drugs. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e617" href="#xd24e617" name=
"xd24e617">iv</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">I have inserted as many of the systematic names as I
could trace, both from Dr. Fleming&rsquo;s work, and those of others;
but I regret, that I was not honored in the acquaintance of any
Botanist who could have assisted me with more.</p>
<p class="par">To the youth of the profession, I trust the work may be
acceptable, by leading them to the knowledge, that such medicines are
in existence; and my medical brethren of the higher grades may not deem
further inquiry into the properties of native drugs beneath their

<p class="par">To the profession at large, then, I beg leave to
dedicate this Translation, with the hope, that they will make due
allowance for all faults, and that some of the more experienced will
favor us with another and better edition.</p>
<p class="par">To my respected friends Messrs. Wilson and Twining, the
profession is indebted, that this little work ever saw light; and
though they are godfathers to none of its errors, yet without their
encouragement and aid, it must have slumbered in oblivion, and remained
as was intended, (after the failure of an attempt on the part of the
translator,) a manual for his own private use. <span class=

&#1575;&#1605;&#1576;&#1577; &#1575;&#1606;&#1576;</span>.&mdash;The
Fruit, <i>Mangifera Indica</i>.</p>
<p class="par">The produce of a large tree very common in Hindostan.
The fruit is about the size of, and very much resembling in shape, a
goat&rsquo;s kidney, and having the external appearance of an apple.
When ripe, it sometimes retains the green color, but oftener becomes
yellow, or red and yellow.</p>
<p class="par">The virtues ascribed to this tree, are as
follows:&mdash;The bruised leaves and young shoots applied to the hair,
expedite its growth, and considerably darken its color.</p>
<p class="par">The bark of the trunk of the tree, and of its roots, is
cooling and astringent; the former powerfully so. The leaves are
astringent, and promote digestion; their ashes styptic.</p>
<p class="par">The young flowers are cool and drying; have a pleasant
aromatic scent, and when taken internally, are cooling and astringent;
recommended for the cure of chronic Gonorrh&oelig;a or Gleet, purulent
expectoration, bilious foulness of the blood and boils. The young
unripe fruit has much acidity, and is drying; moderately used, it
increases all the animal secretions, and is beneficial in chronic
affections of the liver; it promotes appetite, and is lithonthriptic.
The fruit, when ripe, is sweet, cooling, <a id="xd24e2121" name=
"xd24e2121"></a>mucilaginous and heavy, tending to allay thirst, and
useful in nervous affections; strengthens the system, restores impaired
appetite, (is said to moderate an increased secretion of bile,) and
improves the complexion. The fruit is of various sizes, from a few
drachms to a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>pound weight; but it is usually met with weighing
about 4 ounces. It becomes acid about a month after the fall of the
flower, in which state it is used as preserves, such as jellies,
pickles, &amp;c.; at this time, too, it is used as seasoning for
<i>Pilaus</i>, and other dishes; for when the stone or kernel has
become hard, it is no longer fit for these purposes. When the fruit has
attained its full growth, and when nearly ripe, it is to be taken from
the tree, and put into dry grass, straw, or the leaves of the Palass
tree, and there allowed to become ripe; this process deprives it of all
acidity, and also prevents the formation of a resinous gum, which it
contracts when allowed to ripen on the tree, and which renders it too
pungent to be eaten with relish.</p>
<p class="par">The fruit is in perfection in the hot winds, and when
the rains commence, it ripens very fast; before the cold weather it is
usually out of season.</p>
<p class="par">There are some trees that blossom the whole year, and
some few that even produce fruit; but instances of this are very
rare.</p>
<p class="par">There is a variety of this tree on which the fruit is
sweet from its first formation; this requires to be used early,
otherwise it will in all probability become a prey to insects.</p>
<p class="par">Some trees produce fruit only once in 4 years. In
general, it produces fruit in abundance every second year, and less in
the alternate year; some are even perfectly barren every alternate
year.</p>
<p class="par">There is a mode of manuring this tree, which it is said
improves the flavour of the fruit greatly; this is mixing the juice of
its fruit with milk, and pouring it over the roots. It is also said to
be possible to communicate the flavor of any particular fruit to the
mangoe, by its expressed juice being made use of, as an application to
the roots of the tree.</p>
<p class="par">The kernel of the mangoe, roasted, is pleasant to the
taste, and grateful to the stomach; it is much recommended in laxities
of the bowels, and strengthens the <i>prim&aelig; vi&aelig;</i>; water
drank after having eat of this kernel, seems to possess a flavor
peculiarly excellent. The usual mode of preparing them, is to allow
them to remain exposed to the rains, till the shell shall have become
decayed; by this process it is deprived of any heating or irritating
property. <span class="corr" id="xd24e2144" title=
"Source: Perpared">Prepared</span> in this manner, and kept a short
time in lime juice, taken out, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href=
"#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>bruised and mixed with salt, fennel,
&amp;c, it is much extolled for strengthening the stomach, and
promoting digestion.</p>
<p class="par">If preserved for 3 years, pounded, and swallowed to the
quantity of a tolah, with a little water, no medicine is preferable for
strengthening bowels habitually lax.</p>
<p class="par">In the acid state, the fruit is very prejudicial to
those who have any disorders in their teeth, a cough, an affection of
the chest, or who are subject to cholicky pain in the bowels, but very
beneficial when used in irritable habits. The best method of using them
is this. The acid unripe fruit, after the outer rind has been
<span class="corr" id="xd24e2153" title=
"Corrected by author from: pealed">peeled</span> off, is to be cut into
thin slices, and infused for some hours in water; this water so
impregnated, is to be drained off, mixed with a sufficient proportion
of sugar, and used as sherbet. It produces a great relish for food, and
is in other respects beneficial. The same effects are produced by the
unripe fruit, being roasted and allowed to remain in water, as above
mentioned. It is recommended in paralysis, from <i>coup de vent</i>.
Many physicians have considered the mangoe to be of a cooling nature,
but, in my opinion, it is heating in all its stages. The Yunani
physicians have stated the ripe fruit to be hot in the 2d, and dry in
the 3d degree.</p>
<p class="par">Its virtues may be described in a few words. It
strengthens the system, gives tone to the kidnies<a id="xd24e2163"
name="xd24e2163"></a>, restores impaired appetite, &amp;c. It is
aperient, improves the complexion, beneficial in piles, an useful
deobstruent, braces and increases the bulk of the solids, and removes
nervous affections. In some of these disorders I am inclined to doubt
of its good effects, but such virtues are attributed to it. It is
recommended, in order to prevent any bad effects from the fruit in its
unripe state, that raisins be <span class="corr" id="xd24e2165" title=
"Source: eat">eaten</span> with it. Hukeem Alwee Khan, a man of
eminence in his profession in the reign of Mahommed Shah, says, that if
ever this fruit disagreed with the system, it must have been eaten when
unripe or green.</p>
<p class="par">I had occasion to attend a gentleman of very high rank,
who laboured under dropsy; I cured him of the disease, but 3 years
afterwards, having <span class="corr" id="xd24e2170" title=
"Source: eat">eaten</span> a large quantity of mangoes, the disease

<p class="par">Hukeem Alli Mughphoor, physician, states, that
influenced by the resemblance of the mangoe to the human kidney, he
concluded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>that it must be beneficial in that organ, (disorders
of;) he therefore prescribed it in a case of hectic fever, arising from
diseased kidney, and completely cured the disease. In this I differ
from him entirely; he must have mistaken the nature of the complaint,
for a remedy given expressly for the cure of a disease in the kidney,
could <i>not</i>, at the same time, have removed the fever, excepting
appropriate medicines had been administered along with it!!</p>
<p class="par">The best mangoes are those having a thin juice, sweet
and free from fibres; and they ought to be cooled in water or in ice,
especially during the hot weather. It is preferable to use the juice of
the fruit without eating any of the fibrous parts; a neglect of this
may produce various disorders, such as indigestion, cholicky pains,
&amp;c. It is very common to eat the expressed juice, mixed with sugar
and other things, with rice, or with bread, but this is great
imprudence; for in the most healthy subjects it may produce nausea, and
general uneasiness.</p>
<p class="par">Should any ill effects follow the use of the mangoe,
milk, or the kernel of the fruit, will be found a corrector. My
father&rsquo;s opinion is, that these are not the only remedies; for if
it produces any heating effect, curdled milk will give relief, or even
cold water, or acidulated sherbet, and he himself was always in the
habit of using the <i>Phalsa</i> sherbet on these occasions.</p>
<p class="par">Should cholic be produced, the Oil of Almonds or other
sweet oils, will remove the complaint; and a diarrh&oelig;a is to be
cured by the use of the kernel; and a swelling of the abdomen, by milk,
in which a little ginger has been mixed; or even ginger by itself will
have the effect</p>
<p class="par">A substitute for mangoe, as a medicine, may be had in
Chobe Cheenee.</p>
<p class="par">In general, it will be adviseable to abstain from the
use of the mangoe, till 2 or 3 showers of rain have fallen; but those
of a cold phlegmatic or melancholic temperament do not require to be so
particular.</p>
<p class="par">Those for whose complaints mangoes have been
recommended, have in a few months derived great benefit from their use,
by eating them with camel&rsquo;s milk. There are many kinds of this
fruit, and their names are as various; but the stronger the scent, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=

perennial, and becomes a moderate sized tree. The natives, however,
have a prejudice against allowing it to grow beyond 3 or 4 years, and
even this is only in solitary places. The chief reason I fancy is, that
it interferes with the cultivation of the soil, if permitted to remain.
They usually sow it with grain, and reap the grain crop before it has

under its shelter the second year, would not succeed.</p>
<p class="par">A shrub, with broad soft leaves, like the fig tree; it
grows about 6 or 8 feet in height; the root is hollow, and without flaw
or wrinkle; the seed grows in bunches like grapes, and the shell of the
pod, which resembles gall-nuts, is covered with soft prickles. The seed
is like the coffee bean, and is stained with different colored spots,
so as to appear like marbled paper; the kernel is white, soft, and
oleaginous. There are two kinds of this; one with a red, the other with
a green pod; the former is culled <i>Jongia Arnde</i>; both varieties
are sweet, heating, and heavy. The oil of the kernel is useful in
removing obstinate constrictions of the intestines, when given warm;
also in flatulency; rheumatic swellings of the joints and lumbago; in
strangury, spasms in the urinary bladder, headaches, dropsy, and
feverish complaints. It is also recommended as an expectorant in
difficulty of breathing, and in cough; in affections of the skin, and
in superabundance of mucus in the intestines. It is a warm, stimulating
purgative; the dose one or two table spoonsful. Both my father, uncle,
and I, have used it with great success, in cases of obstinate cholic
from costiveness. They also used the leaves moistened with <i>ghee</i>,
as an external application in rheumatic pains and swellings. If the
seeds are bruised, and mixed with curdled milk, and allowed to remain
in this state till <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12"
name="pb12">12</a>]</span>they become putrid, they form an excellent
application for the cure of itch, and usually succeed in 7 or 8 days.
It has also been said, that if one of the kernels be taken at first,
and daily increased by one, till 100 are taken, and then decreased in
the same gradual manner, it will cure Juzam, and other kinds of
Leprosy.</p>

is injurious to the throat, to the solids, to respiration, and to the
intestines; but its corrector is sugar, and if it be sliced, put in
rose water to which sugar is added, and allowed to stand for some time,
its beneficial properties are increased, while its injurious qualities
are prevented or corrected. A preserve made from it, is excellent, and
is used with stews and Pilau, as giving them great additional
relish.</p>

indigestion. The fruit of the plant is sweet and cool, heavy and
purgative, useful in affections from wind, bile, and disorders of the

decreases the seminal secretion, increases mucus, and strengthens the
system. <i>Nourdi Mahommed</i> says, that in the epidemic carbuncle
which affects the armpit or throat, this fruit is given with more
success than any other medicine; and that one fruit given internally,
and another applied to the part, will cure the disease, should there be
any stamina remaining in the system. He also says, that if ten pounds
of this fruit be steeped for a week in Anula water, taken out and
dried, put into a mill, and the oil expressed, and this oil introduced

fingers in breadth, formed of different layers, and lined with a soft
cottony substance. The seed resembles that of the <i>Seriss</i> tree,

hot. It is beneficial in swellings of a general nature, in foulness of
the blood, in difficulty of breathing, in thirst, nausea, and loss of
appetite. Its flowers correct all the natural secretions, and remove
bilious laxity of the bowels, and heartburn. The pod relieves hiccup,
and corrects bilious and mucous secretions; some have described its
properties as cool, and the Dhuntri recommends the first kind, as the

the blood, is useful in prostration of strength from fatigue, and cures
nervous head-aches. Its juice is beneficial in giving tone to the
stomach and heart, and it promotes digestion. It corrects a cold
temperament, cures cholicky disorders, and pains of the bowels, and
this I have repeatedly found by experience. In my own opinion, and in
the opinion of every Yunani writer whom I have consulted, (with the
exception of <i>Shaik Boo Alli</i>,) it is hot; but the physicians of
Hindoostan very generally agree with the <i>Shaik</i>. Those of a hot
temperament, who use much of this plant, are subject to eruptions of
the mouth, and fissures in the tongue. Its correctors are almonds and
the kernel of the cocoa-nut, but the former is to be preferred, and the
addition of the almond increases its effects on the mental powers.</p>

(as it is called in Sanscrit,) Mercury. It is hot, gives strength to
the eyesight, is useful in Juzam, and is vermifuge. A. <i>Zeebuck</i>.
P. <i>Seemab</i>. It is very generally used throughout India, in many
ways, both in its native and prepared state; but in the latter we ought
to be very cautious, for it is seldom sufficiently killed, or removed
from its native state, in which it is a dangerous drug. One grain or
two grains, or even a little more, is taken for a dose, and in some
cases with success. Cups are also made of it, from which milk is drank;
they possess this virtue, that a greater quantity of milk may be taken
in this way than in any other. It is said, that if a little Mercury be
tied up in a cloth, and boiled in milk, that the milk will have an
aphrodisiac property. Should any one have taken live Mercury, and the
result be, that he is attacked with Juzam, or other leprous affection,
let him take the whole of an Indigo plant, and cutting it in small
pieces, let it be boiled in a large quantity of water; then straining
it, drink a cupful of the water very frequently, till all is taken, and
till then eat no food. All the Mercury will in the course of the day be
evacuated per urethra, and if the whole does not make its escape the
first day, the treatment must be repeated. If the urine be received
into a brass vessel, or any other with a polished surface, the Mercury
will be detected; many people having been in this predicament, have
followed this advice, and found the result to be as I have stated it.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=

<p class="par">In a state of calcination, if it is mixed with strong
vinegar, or lime juice, and afterwards dried, if no live Mercury
appears it is good; otherwise it is dangerous. Others have said, that
if mixed and rubbed with the juice of the radish leaf, till they are
incorporated, and then a little lime juice poured over it, and again
rubbed and dried, it will be fit for use; and the less live Mercury
that is perceptible, the less dangerous it is.</p>
<p class="par">To make cups and balls of Mercury, triturate the Mercury
well with pounded bricks, in an iron pot, moistening the mixture with
water; wash the whole in water, and strain through a moderately fine
cloth, till the Mercury becomes perfectly clear like a looking glass.
Take equal parts of this purified quicksilver, rock salt, and sulphate
of copper, and put them into an iron pot, with strong vinegar or lime
juice, and let the whole be well triturated for 7 or 8 hours, when the
compound will appear like butter; wash this well in water, that the
salt and sulphate be carried off, and the Mercury left behind; take
this Mercury and coat over the outside of an unburnt earthen vessel or
cup, till it shall be well covered and appear like Mercury; place this
in a dish filled with lime juice, and let it remain for a week, then
take it out and place it in the sun to dry and harden; when quite hard,
it may be used in this way, or it may be filled with water and kept so,
till the clay becomes soft enough to be separated from the quicksilver.
Milk drank from this cup will have an aphrodisiac quality, and will
increase appetite. For the formation of this cup, 9 or 10 tolahs of
quicksilver will be requisite, and for the balls one tolah.</p>
<p class="par"><i>The Balls.</i>&mdash;When the ingredients
above-mentioned have, from long trituration, acquired the consistence
of butter, balls may be formed of the composition in a fine cloth, and
allowed to remain for 7 days in lime juice; then take them out and
throw them into a boiling decoction of the Dhatura leaves, allowing it
to be well boiled. The balls are then to be taken out of the cloth and
preserved for use.</p>

those of the blood, in cholicky pains from flatulence. Some say, that
it increases the secretion of bile. A preserve is made from the young
shoots which is much esteemed, and is useful in promoting appetite and
giving tone to the stomach, correcting an increased secretion of bile
or phlegm. The young shoots are first cut into small pieces, and
steeped in salt and water; then dried, and afterwards put into the
vinegar or other acid, in which it is to be preserved. The root of the
bamboo in equal parts, with <i>Judw&aacute;r</i> (Zedoary), and

description from the books of foreigners, and partly it is the result

nut, round, more or less so, each weighing about a pice; it is
depressed in the centre, and of a brown color, some darker than others.
Its properties are said to be various. If one of the nuts be strung on

the ear, it will cure tooth-ache, or rubbed into the abdomen of a child

&#1662;&#1607;&#1608;&#1681;&#1609;</span>.&mdash;The name of a grass,
which grows in rocky places, from which it has either derived its name
or from its property of dissolving the stone in the urinary or
gall-bladder. It is a very small plant; its leaves, like those of the
<i>Lobeia</i> (a small bean), when chewed are found to be very
mucilaginous. It is a powerful medicine in dysuria, and is beneficial
in dissolving stones in the urinary or gall-bladder. Of this I have
several times had proof within my own observation; and I have given it
to the extent of 5 or 6 mashas in these disorders, combined with sugar,
or with other diuretic medicines, or sherbets, or even in plain water;
a substitute for this may sometimes be found in Gokroo, in cucumber
seeds, or some such cooling medicine. A distilled water from it is in
use. In one case where I used the Putalphoorie, I found, that while
fresh and green, it was not so beneficial, and induced costiveness; but
when dried and given, it was much more effectual and less
prejudicial.</p>

perfectly sour; when about half ripe, it is hot, heavy, and flatulent,
producing wind, disorders of bile, decreasing aphrodisia and appetite,
and increasing phlegm; when ripe its properties are quite the reverse;
but with respect to the disorders produced by suffusion of bile, I have
not ascertained if it is beneficial or otherwise. The <i>Dara
Shekoi</i> has not noticed this medicine, and for my information I am
indebted to works of Hindoostan. As far as I can judge, it increases
the tone of the stomach, raises the spirits; but taken in quantities,
it is difficult of digestion and produces flatulence. It is acid, and
therefore remedies bile, but it increases cough. The kernel is
astringent.</p>

milk is applied to swellings or boils, it will effect a cure by
resolution; or if applied to the eye, will remove specks on the cornea.
If a tooth be at all loose, the milk applied to it will cause it to
fall out without pain, but care must be taken that it be not applied to
the sound tooth. If the bark <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href=

which fish is fried, it will soften the bones. The young shoots of the
hanging roots and the bark, are cool, dry, and astringent; the milk is
hot and powerful; the fruit less so. If the above-mentioned young
shoots be bruised and put into a cloth, and heated over the fire, it
forms an excellent and affectual application to lumbago or other
rheumatic affections. The fruit, ate with milk and sugar, is mentioned
as aphrodisiac, and increasing certain secretions. The young shoots of
the pendent roots and leaves, and the bark are astringent, and useful

color, or when broken, of a bright red; in figure a little crooked. It
is cool and laxative; it is lithontriptic, cures seminal weakness, and
gonorrh&oelig;a. My late uncle used half of this, and half
<i>Mendhi</i>, as an application to the inside of the hands and soles

equal benefit was derived, as is usually done from the <i>Mendhi</i>.

A very common tree, called also <i>Pullae</i>; it is a large forest
tree, which in season loses its leaves and throws out flowers of an
orange or fire color; its leaves are oval; their breadth about 3 or 4
inches; it is hot, laxative, and stomachic; used in boils, eruptions,
Badqola, gravel, piles, worms, and broken bones. It is written, that
when the white flowers of the Daak are found, and any one shall eat the
seeds and the bark of them, their hearts will be cleansed, their
understanding increased, and they shall then ever be endowed with
supernatural knowledge; it may be advisable to eat <i>moong ka dall</i>
along with it. Its flowers are called <i>Tesoo</i>; they are
astringent, curing disorders of mucus, bile, blood, and difficulty in
making water. If a decoction is prepared from the flowers, and poured
warm from a height on the parts, it will be found useful in pains of
the kidneys, bladder, and in suppression of urine. It is diuretic, and
if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>given with medicines of that class, it will add
greatly to their efficacy. The flowers are excellent as a fomentation
in pains; also hydrocele and schirrous swellings of the testicle may be
greatly benefitted by it. The seeds called <i>Palass papra</i>, are hot
and light; they cure seminal weakness, piles, worms, and disorders of
wind and mucus. In the <i>Maadentezerrabad</i>, &ldquo;<i>Palass
papra</i> is said to be like the seed of the <i>Amultas</i>, round,
broad, and thin, of a dark-brown color; its kernel white, or yellowish,
and perfectly insipid: it is oleaginous, and smells when chewed.&rdquo;
In my opinion, it is useful in phlegm, and the root is beneficial in
cholic. The nurses of Hindoostan put one seed into the mixture, which
they exhibit after parturition, with much benefit, as it is cardiac.
The capsule when whole is also used in decoction. The dose to an adult
is four or five seeds, but beyond that, the opinion of the physician is
necessary. I have used the bark of the seed and the capsule made into
pills, with great success, when mixed with <i>Goor</i>.</p>

on the tongue, to boils, or other eruptions; it removes the bad skin,
and cleanses the parts below. It is purgative; removes wind, and every
complaint of mucus, cold, or itch; its corrector is ghee, or butter,
and its succedaneum <i>Koonush</i>. The dose is three and a half masha,

sown and cultivated with the <i>Paan</i>, because it delights in shady
places. Useful in fever, piles, and mental debility; it is aperient and

very sweet to the taste, and is called the Tirkool.</p>
<p class="par">The upper part of the stem of the fruit is cut across,
and the liquid which exudes from the wound, received into earthen
vessels called Labnahs, and these fill several times in the course of
the day. This liquor is called Taarie: when fresh drawn and before the
sun is above the horizon, it is sweet to the taste; but it soon becomes
fermented, and is then intoxicating. It is cool and moist, beneficial
in disorders of wind and bile, also in boils and eruptions. It is both
aperient, and aphrodisiac. A liquor distilled from the Taarie, is to be
preferred: roasted or stewed meat should <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

flatulent, causes pains in the limbs, cures affections of wind, bile,
blood, and bruises; it relieves general heat, and allays thirst. Its

bile. P. Khoormae Aboojile, or Khoormae Hindee. A. it is called Doom,
but the author of the <i>Munhage</i> says, that Doom means the Googul
tree. The <i>Maadentezerrubad</i> thus describes it: taar is a tree
like the date tree; its leaves about a yard long; the kernel of the
fruit is often sold for the sea cocoanut. The juice of this tree is the
taarie, so well known; it is equally hot and cold, and moist in the 2nd
degree. It is aphrodisiac and diuretic, induces corpulency, and if
taken to excess produces intoxication and head-ache. If fresh drawn, it
is sweet and less intoxicating; but allowed to remain for a night, it
becomes acid, and then it is very inebriating. The fresh taarie
improves the complexion, moistens the brain; is beneficial in hectic
fever, in difficulty of breathing, in depression of the spirits, and is
aperient. If allowed to remain long, it becomes sour, smells very
strong; is heating, and causes vomiting and indigestion.</p>
<p class="par">In the Lyzuttoor rejal, it is thus mentioned: taarrie is
an intoxicating produce of the taar tree, very common to the eastward.
The tree resembles the date tree, but its leaves are different: when
fresh, the taarie is hot and moist, induces corpulency; is aphrodisiac,
diuretic, and when it has acquired a strong smell, is intoxicating, and
in that state, it is very heating, and produces indigestion, with
heaviness of the brain. The sherbet of the pomegranate allays vomiting
brought on by its use. Its succedaneum is a decoction of dates called
Sendhi.</p>

Tabacum</i>, W. It is said in the <i>Dara Shekoi</i>, that it was first
sown in India during the reign of <i>Akber</i>, or in the year of the
Hidjera 1014, when it was imported from Europe, and sown by his order;
now it is every where common, and is generally smoked. In the opinion
of Hukeem Alli Gheelanee, it is hot and dry; its smoke from its heating
quality confuses the ideas, and reduces the strength; from its
discutient property, it weakens the brain, and depresses the spirits.
Those who are of a cold, moist temperament, may derive benefit from its
use, but those who are of equal temperament cannot use it with
impunity. It is useful in piles the consequence of cold, also in
waterbrash, and complaints of this nature; it promotes digestion and
dissipates flatulent pains. It increases the strength of vision when it
is weakened by the effects of cold, but adds to it when it has been
caused by heat. In difficulty of breathing or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>pain in
the chest, proceeding from an accumulation of viscid phlegm, it is very
useful. It is prejudicial in thin spare habits; it shuts all the
passages, decreases the power of the absorbents, and consequently
prevents the absorption of chyle, thereby weakening the system, and
drying up and emaciating the body. It produces hectic fever in the
aged, and many other disorders in which medicine is useless. Its
corrector, according to the author of the Dara Shekoi, is milk; and he
gives this wise reason for it, that cloth stained with the smoke of
tabacco can only be cleaned with milk. It is used in many ways, chewed,
snuffed, smoked, &amp;c. but is least prejudicial when smoked, after
being mixed up with <i>goor</i> and preserves. I have by experience
found it effectual in wind of the stomach, in pains produced by
flatulence, and in the waterbrash; but have found it prejudicial to
those labouring under depression of spirits, or who are subject to
heartburns.</p>
<p class="par">The dried plant brought from Surat is more drying than

strengthens the brain, and prevents the effects of indigestion on that
organ, but it should not be used when people have weak eyes from heat.
The author of the Ulfaz Udwiyeh says, that he had a friend who was
blind, and that meeting him afterwards quite recovered, he was
surprised to learn that his cure had been effected by his having smoked
equal parts of tobacco and <i>Sumhaloo</i>; the women eat the Surat
tobacco with <i>pawn</i>: and it increases digestion, and is
discutient. It is beneficial in those temperaments which are cold and
moist, and its juice is used for drying the vagina.</p>

Jambolana.</i>&rdquo; One of the largest of trees; its leaves about 3
inches long and half an inch broad, of an oval shape. The fruit is
round and of three kinds, the <i>Deeriaie</i>, the <i>Bhagaie</i>, and
<i>Sehraie</i>. Of the <i>Bhagaie</i>, there are two kinds, the largest
called <i>Churputtra</i> and the common <i>Jamun</i>. The common name
of the <i>Deeriaie</i> is <i>Nadeye</i>. All kinds are dry and
astringent; cures disorders of mucus, bile, blood, and boils and
eruptions, but when the fruit is large it is sweet, and difficult of
digestion; it cures swellings in the body. Some have called the <i>Ray
Jamun</i> hot. The <i>Sehraie</i> is strengthening, and increases
semen. There is a kind of <i>Jamun</i> grown in Delhi, that is without
stones, and very sweet; in my opinion this is the best of all, and next
to it must rank the <i>Ray Jamun</i>.</p>
<p class="par">That fruit which is found in the latter end of the rains
is called <i>Bhadeya</i>, and is also sweet. In my opinion it is cool
and moist, and stomachic, but the one without the stone, named
<i>B&egrave;d&aacute;na</i>, is more so than the other kinds.</p>
<p class="par">The juice of the fruit is to be preferred as a
stomachic, and is more grateful to the taste. It is best prepared by
being sprinkled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>with salt, and shaken in a dish, which deprives it
of its great astringency and corrects its hurtful qualities.</p>
<p class="par">There is a kind of jamun of the color of dry grass, of a
yellowish white color, smaller than those described, of a pleasant
smell. Nawab Assoph-ul-Dowlah at Lucknow, taking into consideration its
scarcity, brought it from the eastward, and sowed it in his gardens. It
is the now common <i>goolaub jamun</i>, and smells of roses; there is
also a kind of jamun at Lucknow called <i>Phalenda</i>.</p>

Its fresh leaves are used as an application to inflamatory <i>Daad</i>,
or other watery eruptions, as well as the common <i>Daad</i>. This I
have found from experience. <i>Sybr</i> is first applied to produce
some inflammation, and then this application is made use of. A patient
of mine was long annoyed with <i>Daad</i> in both his shoulders, for
the cure of which he had tried many remedies. I recommended this, he
took a quantity of the leaves, bruised them, and applied them over the
parts, but from the great heat and irritation they produced, he quickly
removed them; he then applied the Mooltance earth, to remove the
irritation, this so far succeeded, but the part rose in blisters, the
water from the blisters being discharged, the complaint was found
relieved, when the parts were well, he again applied the leaves, this
destroyed the disease, and left the place all black. The skin soon
re-assumed its wonted color, and the disease was perfectly cured. From
the above circumstance, I am led to conclude, that the application is a
very powerful one, and acts as a blister. If they are applied to parts
which have been deprived of sensation, it will be equally effectual as
<i>Sutoobria</i>.</p>

called it sweet and cool, and have described many varieties of it,
white, yellow, red, and grey; but I fancy the difference is merely
confined to the color of the flowers; some have said that it diminishes
strength. Its flowers are peculiarly beautiful. If its leaves are
bruised and applied moist to swellings, it either resolves the tumour

cool, cures boils and eruptions, poisons, aches, and swellings. If a

juice of the leaves dropped into the eye, it <span class=

kills maggots. The smell of the flower is useful in head-aches and
hemicrania, in cough and in jaundice. If the root of the white Seriss
be kept in the mouth, it lengthens aphrodisia. Some have called this
<i>Layetoolatees</i>. If the seeds be bruised with water, and this
dropt into the eye, it will remove specks; the oil of the seed is also
very effectual for this purpose.</p>

cow&rsquo;s urine, and taken thrice a day, it will cure the bite of a
snake, and for one whole year no reptile will injure you. The bark of
an aged tree is the best. When the sun shall be in the division Joura,
if daily for three days, 6 mashas of the bark be taken in congee, it
will render the person invulnerable to the bite of any noxious reptile

<p class="par">The <i>Sillajeet</i> is dissolved in water and placed in

vessel; this too is placed in the sun, well protected from dust, till
it becomes dry. This is the <i>Sut Sillajeet</i>, and what remains in
the first vessel is again purified in the same manner for three
different times, and each time the pure drug is dried as above. It is
easily purified by fire, and more quickly; but this is much to be
preferred. It is brought from the hills ready prepared.</p>

goat, which when the animal is rutting, is discharged on the stones and
evaporated by the sun&rsquo;s heat. It is found in small quantities, of
a black color. It is hot in the 3rd, and dry in the 2nd degree. In the
opinion of Indian physicians, it is useful in all kinds of seminal
weakness, in swellings, in Juzam, epilepsy, diabetes, stone in the
bladder, and in gravel. The <i>Sillajeet</i> is often mixed with lime,
but the adulteration is discovered by the change of color. Some have
said that it is the urine of the wild ass, found as above. The purified
kind is the best. In Juzam, if ate for 40 days, it is a cure, and even

always exhibit with correctors, for this reason such remedies are
seldom noticed or used by them. The physicians of India, on the

in the habit of seldom giving these remedies internally, but I usually
confine my use of them to external application, and as aphrodisiacs,

and piles; it produces eruptions from diffusion of bile, and some have
called it difficult of digestion. Those who are in a reduced state, or
have weak stomachs, had better not eat more than 20 direms. To my
knowledge, it is much used in piles; it is said to be beneficial in
cholics and pains in the bowels. It increases bile; and is hurtful in
disorders of blood; it is also injurious to the throat. Its correctors
are fresh <i>dhaie</i>, and being parboiled in water and the water
changed. It may also be corrected by being boiled with tamarind or
anula leaves. Enclosed in clay and roasted in an oven, the outer rind
pulled off, it will be found less hurtful; in any other manner it
irritates the throat. If used in powder, it must be skinned and dried
in the shade; one kind of it is white inside, and of a purple color
externally. A third is white on both sides; the former is the
strongest: it is also named <i>Soorunsona</i>.</p>

Heptaphyllum.</i> Silk-cotton Tree.&rdquo; A large tree of India; its
leaves like the Jamin, but broader and more long, about half the
breadth of the peepul and twice the length; in thickness, color, and
mark, the same. Its flowers resemble the <i>Bukaen</i> when small, but
when more advanced, it becomes more like the <i>goolur</i>, and when
full grown, the flowers are as large as a large lime. It then spreads
and becomes red; after this it again closes; the flower then falls, and
leaves the seed vessel. The capsule is twice as large as that of the
<i>Mudar</i>, and when ripe, is filled with cotton. I have ate of the
flower when at its middle growth, and found it pleasant to the taste,
but it produces flatulence. It is cool and aphrodisiac; induces
corpulence; is astringent, and cures boils and eruptions, Juzam, and
disorders of the blood and bile: some call its gum <i>Moocherus</i>,
the author of the Topha for instance; but <i>Moocherus</i> is the gum
or flower of the Phoopul tree. In the opinion of the physicians of
India, the Sembill is a powerful medicine as an aphrodisiac. If the
juice of the root be made into sherbet with equal part of sugar, it
will increase age by restoring the vital energy, increase understanding
and semen; the larger and older the tree, and the thicker the root, the
greater its strength as a medicine. The small roots are cut into
slices, dried on a rope, and sold; in this state, it resembles
<i>Bhamun Soorkh</i>.</p>
<p class="par">Ascetics have said, that the perpendicular root of a
large full grown Sembill tree, cut in pieces, dried and reduced to a
powder is powerfully aphrodisiac, in the quantity of 4 direms daily. I
have taken this powder to the quantity of one tolah with sugar, and
have also prescribed it with advantage; it strengthens the stomach, and
is gently laxative. If given with honey, I conceive that its virtues
will be increased. The author of the celebrated work <i>Ahmed Ben
Shirazee</i> has told the following story, which I shall relate as
nearly as may be in his own words. &ldquo;I was,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;on a journey, when coming to a village in India, and being very
thirsty, I met an old man from whom I requested water to drink; I
observed that this old man had a peculiarly healthy appearance, and
seemed plump and stout; he had a young woman <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>with
him, whom he sent to his house for water, and who brought it me to
drink. I then asked him whether that young girl was his daughter; he
laughing answered that she was his wife, and that he had three others
equally young. I was somewhat surprised at this, and asked him if this
was not too many for him; he replied no! More and more astonished, I
asked him if this was really the case; he avowed it to be so. I then
questioned him how he came to be endowed with so much strength, and how
old he was; he told me that his age was 110 years, and related the
following facts: That when 50 years&rsquo; old he had already become
aged and feeble, and was so much decayed in constitution, that he
seldom rose from his bed, and when he did so, was obliged to support
himself on a crutch. That a fakeer passing that way observed his feeble
state, and feeling compassion for his helpless situation, asked him
what ailed him: he replied, nothing; but that old age had come upon
him. The fakeer then gave him a medicine which he had taken ever since,
with an injunction to abstain from all acids: this he had done, and
that the effect was such as I saw. He likewise told me that he had a
son nearly 80 years of age, who had also used the fakeer&rsquo;s
prescription, and who was much stouter and more healthy in every
respect than he.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Astonished at this relation, I procured the
receipt, and thus hand it down to posterity.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Take the white roots of a full grown, healthy
Sembill tree, which is soft; cut them in pieces, dry them in the shade,
and reduce them to a powder: sift it very fine, with equal parts of
sugar, and over the fire, form it into an electuary: of this 5 direms
are to be eaten daily, and no acid to be used.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To this the old man swore, and brought his son
and introduced him to me to prove the truth of his story. The son
corroborated the assertion of his father, and added that he had ate the
remedy only two years, when he became as he then was; certain it is, he
had not a grey hair in his head.&rdquo;</p>

flower is small and of a yellowish color. Its seed is like the
pistachio nut, but more broad <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105"

strengthens the stomach; is aphrodisiac; cures bilious disorders;
increases mucus, and the Hindoos have recommended it for the cure of
wind; but in this I do not concur, as it is rather apt to produce wind;
they are however in the habit of recommending all medicines that
procure a discharge of flatus. One kind is called <i>Golesemb</i>, also
called <i>Krishnphilla</i>; its seed is larger and longer than the one

antidote to poison, useful in affections of the spleen, Juzam,
idiotism, marasmus, and itchiness of the bowels, flatulent swellings,
badgola, swellings in general, and is lithontriptic. The best kind is
red or of a rose color; its milk is also red, but if put on a cloth it

common tree of Hindostan, large like the Jamin, and its wood is durable
and excellent; it is not readily attacked by insects nor liable to
decay. If cut down when the moon is in the wane, no insect will ever
touch it; its leaves are small and round, a little inclining to oval,
with very little point, like the leaf of the Semb. Its seed-vessel is
light, and contains only two or three seeds; it is about half an inch
long; both kinds of the tree are hot, and reduce corpulency. It also
causes abortions; cures Juzam and white leprosy; is vermifuge; removes
pains in the urinary bladder; useful in boils, eruptions, heat of body,
disorders of the blood and mucus, and allays vomiting. It is
particularly useful in disorders of the blood and cuticular eruptions;
this is a favorite wood among Europeans. It is also useful in Lues
Venerea, and is thus used: one and half masha of the filings of the

The name of a common flower, which has a strong scent in the night; it
is of several kinds, white, yellow, red, and yellowish red. It is hot
and dry in the second degree; three direms taken in water, is diuretic,
and also useful in suppression of the menses. It expedites the delivery
of the dead f&oelig;tus and of the placenta. Its smell expels mucus
from the brain and collections of wind. In those of a hot temperament
it produces head-ache. Its corrector is oil of roses, vinegar, or its
own oil; the latter is very beneficial both externally and internally
used, and possesses all the beneficial properties attributed to the
flower. An unguent composed of this, Akirkirrha, and Tokhur Unjeera,
applied to the loins, is very beneficial in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>two

root of a tree in the jungles, of a prickly kind; its stem and branches
are thin, with many smaller ones, about an inch or two inches long in
the intervals. Its leaves are very thin and small, somewhat like the
Fir tree. The tree itself grows to the height of 9 or 10 feet; its seed
resembles the Anboo Saleb. It is sweet, cool, moist, and heavy; cures
disorders of wind, mucus, bile, and blood, also swellings of the body.
It is aphrodisiac; increases the secretion of milk, and is an
ingredient in celebrated formul&aelig;. For increasing the consistence
of semen, and as an aphrodisiac, I have found its conserve and powder
of great use. One kind of it is called Kalinta, another Maha Shutawuri;
they are cool; cure piles and laxities from indigested food, disorders
of the eyes; are cardiac, aphrodisiac, and increase knowledge.</p>

shrub of India, smaller than the Kurela; it has many hair-like fibres
of a green colour over its surface, and it has numerous seeds. Its
properties are the same as the <i>Kurela</i>. It is useful in that
eruption which takes place on the face in puberty; beneficial in fever
and phlegm, and creates appetite. One kind of it is called <i>Banje
Kakora</i>. It is bitter, an antidote to poisons; useful in that
eruption of the face called acne punctata. Its root is used in Zaerbad,
in discussing swellings, and in the bites of all noxious reptiles, and
it is also of benefit in cough. Some have said, that this is the wild
<i>Kurela</i>, but this is not the fact, for the wild <i>Kurela</i> is
essentially different and more resembles the garden sort.</p>

&ldquo;<i>Spheranthus Indicus.</i>&rdquo; It is also called
<i>Tuppodenie</i>, so denominated from its being used in penance; if
any one preserves a constant respect for this, he will become the
peculiar favorite of Heaven. It is also called <i>Srawanie</i>; this
name is derived from the circumstance of its bearing fruit in the month
<i>Srawun</i>. The leaf is somewhat like the mint, the flower round or
globulated, and of a rose-color; it has a sweet smell, and is a
medicine of great virtue. It is sweet and a little bitter, but very
much so during digestion; it is hot, light; increases understanding; is
vermifuge; useful in boils and eruptions of an obstinate nature; is
pungent; cures pains in the parts of generation of the female,
marasmus, gonorrh&oelig;a, and disorders of bile. If the plant be
pulled out by the root before it flowers, and dried in the shade, and
ate with wheat flour, cow&rsquo;s ghee, and sugar, it will restore and
preserve youth, and prevent the hair from becoming grey; and if pounded
and often used in powder, it will be found peculiarly tonic. If its
seed be ate with sugar, it will preserve health to the extreme of old
age.</p>
<p class="par">An old man is said to have eaten a preparation of this
for a year constantly: the strength of youth was restored to him, and
he lived to the age of 205 years. The physicians of India declare this
to be the basis of the <i>Elixir Vit&aelig;</i>. If the plant is taken
before it flowers, and is bruised and eaten with ghee and honey, both
the strength and appearance of youth will be preserved. Indeed, the
extent of its virtues is only known to the most scientific of
physicians. If its flowers are eaten for 40 days, the same effect will
be produced; and the root used without intermission for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>a
year, incalculable benefit will be the result. If the root and leaves
be bruised and eaten for three days, with cow&rsquo;s milk and honey,
it will be found highly aphrodisiac. If one of the seeds be swallowed
without water, the eye-sight will be preserved, and no affection of the
eyes will take place for a year. If two are swallowed, the eye-sight
will be preserved for two years, and <i>so on</i>. I used it myself in
my infancy, or early days, and have preserved my sight in a wonderful
manner. My uncle used the distilled water of this, in depression of the
spirits, and as a cardiac, with great success: he sometimes distilled
from equal parts of this and <i>Gowjeban</i>, at other times with other
cardiac medicines. If half a masha of the oil of this be ate with
<i>Paan</i> in the cold weather, it will produce a genial warmth over
the body; it will also remove affections from cold, and be found
aphrodisiac. The oil is thus procured:</p>
<p class="par">The plant is moistened with water, and then rubbed
between the hands with any sweet-scented oil, but not too much; it is
then to be extracted in the same manner as that of <i>Agur</i> is
procured. If a chittack of the following oil be eaten daily for 40
days, and during this time abstaining from intercourse with woman, it
will be found that the aphrodisiac power will have become so great,
that it will seem wonderful. It is thus prepared:</p>
<p class="par">Take the leaves, root, and all parts of the plant;
bruise them, sprinkling a little water over them; then squeeze out 20
seers of the juice, and add to it five seers of sweet oil; boil the
whole till the juice shall have evaporated, and the residue is the oil.
Some use the medicine in this manner. During the months of August and
September, with cow&rsquo;s ghee. In April and May, with honey. In June
and July, with sugar. In February and March, with congee. In October
and November, with cow&rsquo;s milk; and in December and January, with
sour milk. The author of the <i>Dhara Shekoi</i> has said that the root
is to be bruised in a copper vessel, with a pestle of the Neeb tree,
adding a little water, till it has become black; then taken up by
dipping cotton into it, and preserved for use. In the ophthalmia, a
little of the cotton moistened and applied to the eye, will remove the
disease. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=

<p class="par">A very common and large tree of India, much esteemed; it
is of four kinds, the medicinal properties of all the same. It is
astringent and bitter; pungent and cool, (some say hot and dry;) some
call its qualities in equilibrium; it is quick of digestion; useful in
disorders of bile, wind, and mucus, and I have known it to be of use in
Juzam and white leprosy. I have also exhibited it with success in
eruptions and scabies. One man I knew, whose whole body was white from
leprosy. I prescribed it to him for 40 days, and cured him. I took the
kernel of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>seed, bruised and sifted it, and gave it in the
quantity that might be contained in the palm of his hand, fasting, and
prohibited him from using any other kind of food than bread or
<i>dhal</i>, without salt or ghee.</p>
<p class="par">It is also said by <i>Hukeem Ali</i> to be excellent in
curing obstinate old ulcers, as also fistula in ano, by the application
of its leaves. It is given in many and various ways. Its leaves are
given fresh, sometimes dried and pounded, sometimes its juice is given,
often the juice of the leaf buds, and not unfrequently its bark. It is
likewise given mixed with <i>Noora</i>. Its juice is used with
<i>Noora</i> to cleanse foul ulcers, and to cure carbuncle, and this it
effects in a very short time. The <i>Noora</i> is added to it in
one-eighth of its quantity, and <i>Hukeem Ali</i> has declared it to be
the best ingredient in ointment that he ever tried.</p>
<p class="par">I have often used the leaves heated as an application to
swellings and boils; it in some cases resolved them, in others
expedited suppuration, and in all was beneficial. I have added salt to
the bruised leaves for the same purpose, and found that it added to its
efficacy.</p>
<p class="par">A decoction of the leaves as a fumigation is excellent
in discussing swellings, and with the addition of the leaves of the
Sumhaloo, with additional good effect. A fumigation of less heating
properties may be obtained by the leaves of the <i>Anbassaleb</i>,
being substituted for the <i>Sumhaloo</i>. The water of this decoction
is useful in cleansing foul ulcers, and removing pain from the
joints.</p>
<p class="par">The <i>Neeb</i> in the opinion of Indian physicians is
cool, and <i>Hukeem Urzanee</i> has described its qualities as equal.
If the decoction is used as a wash for the hair, it will darken its
color, and increase its growth; and if the juice of its young leaves in
the quantity of five or six direms be taken for seven days, it will
cure scabies, ring-worm, and all kinds of acne, and it will purify the
blood. A decoction of the bark of its root will restore suppressed
menses, and if taken with goor it will produce abortion: prepared in
this manner it will cure the under-mentioned diseases. <span class=

<p class="par">All species of scabies, white leprosy, Juzam, (when not

the head, it will remove head-ache. Its juice is vermifuge. If three
masha of the leaf buds with half masha of black peepul be eaten for 21

strength of vision, and by its juice being introduced into the eyes,
will cure night-blindness.</p>
